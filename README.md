# Unity-Netcode-Extras
Implementation of clientside prediction, reconciliation, and entity interpolation in Netcode for GameObjects. It isn't stable at the moment,
but eventually this package will be able to seamlessly mesh with most Unity Netcode projects and will make implementation of clientside prediction, reconciliation, and entity interpolation much easier.

Please note that no license is provided, and this project isn't currently intended to be for public use/reproduction. Rather, it is intended
to be an educational tool.
